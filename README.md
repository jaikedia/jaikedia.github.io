### [Analyzing Safety Reports using ML/NLP | Research Thesis | Indian Institute of Technology Madras]()
Advisors: Prof. Nikhil Bugalia and Prof. Ashwin Mahalingam

This research focused on developing automated classification systems for construction safety reports using machine learning approaches. Working with a dataset of 12,000 safety observations from a Kuwait construction site, we developed and evaluated novel text mining methods to classify worker-reported safety incidents.

#### Key Contributions:
1. Developed a systematic analysis framework for processing and classifying construction safety reports
2. Implemented and compared 7 different machine learning classifiers for multi-class safety report classification
3. Achieved strong classification performance with F1 scores of 0.82 for Unsafe Conditions, 0.77 for Good Observations, and 0.62 for Unsafe Acts
4. Enhanced Random Forest model performance through optimization, improving F1 score from 0.74 to 0.77
5. Conducted sensitivity analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to improve prediction accuracy
6. Validated the practical applicability of ML-based classification through industry stakeholder collaboration

1. Journal Paper: "Machine learning-based automated classification of worker-reported safety reports in construction." Journal of Information Technology in Construction
2. Conference Paper: "Classification of safety observation reports from a construction site: An evaluation of text mining approaches." PMI Research & Academic Virtual Conference

#### This research demonstrates the potential of machine learning in automating safety report classification, offering significant efficiency gains in construction safety management. The developed models can help safety managers quickly identify and respond to safety concerns, ultimately contributing to improved workplace safety.
